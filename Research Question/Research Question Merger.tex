Question
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How did incoming Tokyo-Fu managers choose employees from Tokyo-Shi?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Did retention spillover from higher to lower positions?

            (i.e. Did a retained clerk recommend his co-working engineer to new manager?)

            \item Does length of working together predict retention?

            \item Were retained Tokyo-Shi workers have similar educational socio-economic background?

            \item Do productivity of an employee predict retention?
        \end{enumerate}
